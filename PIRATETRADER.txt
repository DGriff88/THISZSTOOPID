PIRATETRADER - OPTIONS PAYCHECK MODE
==========================================

RULE ONE: No new spread can be opened to "cover" a leg. If a stray leg exists, it must be closed first. No compounding. CANCEL ALL GTC NIGHTLY!!!

Your "shift" is to scan, stalk, and execute a handful of good trades that pay the bills.

At the end of the week, you close the shop, log the paycheck, and reset for Monday.


KEY DISCIPLINE
==============

One spread at a time per ticker.
No stray legs.
Cancel GTC nightly.
Walk rule: +$200/day OR 3 reds = stop.
Think weekly: "These 3–5 trades are my job this week."


TRADE TYPES FOR WEEKLY CYCLE
============================

1. Momentum Pop Spread (call/put debit spread on breakout + retest)
   - RVOL ≥ 1.5 and rising
   - Fresh catalyst ≤4h old
   - Debit ≤ $80

2. EMA Pullback Spread (ride the slope, capture 1–2R)
   - 50 EMA slope aligned with trade direction
   - Entry on pullback to VWAP/21EMA
   - RSI/Stoch/MACD confirm momentum

3. Oversold Bounce (yesterday setup)
   - Daily RSI(5) < 32 or BB tap
   - First green candle + volume, RSI >30
   - Options: short put spread (bullish) or call spread

4. Occasional credit spread on strong levels for income
   - Only on high-conviction setups
   - OI ≥ 1,000; bid/ask ≤ $0.20

Each trade = $40–80 risk, aiming $100–200 reward. Two winners in a week = paycheck met.


WEEKLY PAYCHECK FRAMEWORK
=========================

Goal:
$300–$500/week baseline (on $2.3k account).
Stretch goal: $750–$1,000/week when setups align.
Paycheck = sum of 2–5 defined-risk trades, not daily flipping.

Monday–Tuesday: Setup & Entry
-----------------------------
Run scanner → tag 2–3 A+ setups (fresh catalyst, RVOL ≥1.5, ≤$80 debit).
Place 1–2 spreads max.
Idea: open one short-term debit spread (3–7 DTE) and maybe one swing spread if catalyst strong.

Wednesday–Thursday: Manage & Add
-------------------------------
If winners are running, scale partials / lock some profit.
If flat or red but still valid (VWAP/EMA holding), let them ride.
Maybe 1 more fresh entry if catalyst is A+.

Friday: Cash Out & Reset
-----------------------
Close all weeklies → collect paycheck.
Do not carry multiple weeklies into weekend.
Only exception: LEAP / swing with months left (like NVDA).
