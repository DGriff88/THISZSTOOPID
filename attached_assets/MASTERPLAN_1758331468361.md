## 🎯 ADVANCED TRADING STRATEGIES

### EMA CONFIRMATION ENTRY STRATEGY
**Purpose:** Filter fakeouts/manipulation and nail high-probability entries

#### 1. Identify Market Trend With EMAs
- 3 EMAs (9/21/50 or 9/21/160)
- Uptrend: fast > mid > slow
- Downtrend: fast < mid < slow
- ⚠️ Skip tangled/flat EMAs

#### 2. Pullback Into Dynamic EMA S/R
- Wait for price to pull into EMA zone
- Check candles, wicks & volume
- ⚠️ Rejection wicks = possible fakeout

#### 3. Confirm With RSI
- RSI(14) 40-60 = chop; avoid
- Long: RSI 40→70
- Short: RSI 60→30
- Bonus: RSI divergence

#### 4. Fakeout / Manipulation Filters
Avoid when:
- Break closes back in range
- Lone news spike
- Volume dries up

#### 5. Confirm With Stochastic Oscillator
- Use Stoch (14,3,3) or (5,5,3)
- ✓ %K under20→80 (bull)
- ✓ %K over80→20 (bear)
- Bonus: Stoch+RSI crossover

#### 6. Emotion Filter & Precision Entry
Enter only when EMAs, RSI & Stoch agree
Triggers:
- Engulfing/hammer off EMA
- 5-min break of 15-min
- LTF break with HTF trend
