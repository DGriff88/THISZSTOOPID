Your “shift” is to scan, stalk, and execute a handful of good trades that pay the bills.

At the end of the week, you close the shop, log the paycheck, and reset for Monday.




Key Discipline

One spread at a time per ticker.

No stray legs.

Cancel GTC nightly.

Walk rule: +$200/day OR 3 reds = stop.

Think weekly: “These 3–5 trades are my job this week.”


Trade Types for Weekly Cycle

Momentum Pop Spread (call/put debit spread on breakout + retest).

EMA Pullback Spread (ride the slope, capture 1–2R).

Oversold Bounce (yesterday setup).

Occasional credit spread on strong levels for income.

Each trade = $40–80 risk, aiming $100–200 reward. Two winners in a week = paycheck met.





Weekly Paycheck Framework





Goal:

$300–$500/week baseline (on $2.3k account).

Stretch goal: $750–$1,000/week when setups align.

Paycheck = sum of 2–5 defined-risk trades, not daily flipping.



Monday–Tuesday: Setup & Entry

Run scanner → tag 2–3 A+ setups (fresh catalyst, RVOL ≥1.5, ≤$80 debit).

Place 1–2 spreads max.



Idea: open one short-term debit spread (3–7 DTE) and maybe one swing spread if catalyst strong.



Wednesday–Thursday: Manage & Add

If winners are running, scale partials / lock some profit.

If flat or red but still valid (VWAP/EMA holding), let them ride.

Maybe 1 more fresh entry if catalyst is A+.



Friday: Cash Out & Reset

Close all weeklies → collect paycheck.

Do not carry multiple weeklies into weekend.

Only exception: LEAP / swing with months left (like NVDA).
